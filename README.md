# NYC_CityBike_Tableau
NYC CityBike data analysis (2018) using Tableau & Python

## Data Source
The data for this analysis was obtained from the [public website](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) of New York's CitiBike System.
I used Citi Bike Trip Histories from 2018 and only for New York City and not Johnson City (JC-files). The data was provided on monthly csv
files, which were later analyzed, transform and load into a new csv file using Python. The code for performing the ETL process is provided
in both a Jupyter Notebook and a *.py format.

Users in New York City made 17,537,059 trips in 2018...that's a lot of data!

In fact, is so much data that I could not upload the csv files directly into my repository. If you are interested in replicating the exercise, please download the data from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MQI9co9Loc1voWAdtecQFWFuOzGb_cKV?usp=sharing). The Trips_Data_2018.csv is the file that contains all the information after running the python code. The monthly files can be found in the Trips_data folder. I changed the name according to the month they belong to, but they are the same hosted in CitiBike public site for 2018.

## Tableau Story
The resulting csv file was afterwards analyze using Tableau Desktop, creating an interactive story to visualize and play with data.
This story can be check in this [link](https://10ay.online.tableau.com/t/marianajimenez/views/NYC_CityBike2018_Analysis/Analysis?iframeSizedToWindow=true&:embed=y&:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=no&:showVizHome=no#2) leading to my personal Tableau Online's site.
